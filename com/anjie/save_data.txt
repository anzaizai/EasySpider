Same goes for the earlier version of this program at https://sites.google.com/site/reusablesec/Home/password-cracking-tools/probablistic_cracker\r\nThere are other PCFG implementations by other groups and they are under their own licenses. For example the CMU team wrote their own version from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThings get a bit tricky on the commercial usage of PCFGs for password policy enforcement, (for example usages like zxcvb to make stronger passwords) due to the fact that Florida State University, (not me), owns a lot of the original research. In that case I recommend contacting Dr. Sudhir Aggarwal at sudhir@cs.fsu.edu.\r\n\r\nAs Maximilian already pointed out, this code here currently only supports generating guesses on CPUs, (I use a *ton* of memory and don't distribute the work much). That being said, depending on the hash type the back-end cracker can absolutely run on GPUs.  Aka you can pipe the results of pcfg_manager.py into GPU hashcat. In most cases the PCFG generates guesses way too slow to make full use of the back-end GPU, but there are some situations, such when attacking a large number of salted hashes, or really slow file encryption, it works quite well.\r\n\r\nAlso, the basic idea of using PCFGs should be able to be applied in GPUs if you are willing to use a threshold based approach to generating guesses vs. a probability order approach. Aka Hashcat's Markov mode which can run on GPUs is drastically different than CPU Markov implementations like OMEN and JTR's Incremental mode, (though Maximilian can correct me on the OMEN comment ;p), I've yet to get beyond the drawing on bar napkins stage of development of that though.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the lack of documentation. That's also on my todo list but in all honesty I doubt I'll be getting around to that anytime soon. If you have any more questions though feel free to ask!\r\n\r\nAlso, on my todo list is to merge the \"Development and Testing\" branch back into \"Master\". There's a ton of improvements in that which so far seem to make it significantly better. If you're feeling adventurous I'd recommend going off that branch instead. If you run into any problems *please* let me know since that'll really help me as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again and good luck!\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-09-18T01:36:29Z"},{"id":"6601524885","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":3666795,"login":"renfan","display_login":"renfan","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renfan","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3666795?"},"repo":{"id":103244836,"name":"renfan/fsyfzx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renfan/fsyfzx"},"payload":{"push_id":1990935605,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/master","head":"c363ea0ed1cccdcb840733a3d6fec4aaed35116c","before":"a75cc3e4296ea9658eeac3cac2215ff7755efa06","commits":[{"sha":"c363ea0ed1cccdcb840733a3d6fec4aaed35116c","author":{"email":"renfan1204@qq.com","name":"renfan"},"message":"large
